# Welcome to the Hexo Web Development Chronicles!

## About

This blog is dedicated to sharing my journey as a web developer, as well as providing helpful tips, resources, and insights for other developers. Here, you'll find a mix of personal experiences and technical information, all with the goal of helping others grow in their development careers.

I have a diverse professional background, including experience in construction and oil and gas production, and a strong foundation in problem-solving. My technical skills include expertise in the MERN stack, Git, AWS, Node.js, React, MongoDB, Express servers, Socket.io, SQL, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm always learning and growing as a developer, and I hope that this blog can be a helpful resource for others on their own development journey. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful!
